# Audio mix backend
This repository represents simple application that mixes input audio with pre existing audio effect, using FFmpeg. 
This application was written due to technical lecture to AnyVoice partners.

## Hometask

1. Maybe as you mentioned, in our application we copied multiple assets to change user voice background, but used only one. Your task is to modify our system to allow user to select which audio effect he wants to use in his voice
2. As you maybe mentioned, now we can upload anything to our application, even if file is not a valid audio file, for example: gif, zip archive, video, and so on. Your task is to implement validation. If uploaded file is a valid audio file
3. Make any voice sounds like a different voice (for example, Dart Vaider, or Sponge Bob). If you do this task, we will propose you a free internship in the AnyVoice team.

You can create PR in this repository with your solutions.
